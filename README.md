# AndroidTestApp

A simple Test-App that tries to contain as many basic functionality as possible. It serves for my own practise and as a resource to look up code. Comparing changes in between commit might help to understand what to change/add for a certain functionality.
<br><br>So far the app includes:
* Buttons
* TextViews
* A Checkbox
* RadioButtons
* Spinner(Dropdown)
* A ProgressBar
* A Switch
* A Coloured View
* A Navigation Drawer
* An Image View
* A ScrollList
